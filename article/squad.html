                Hunkered in a small mud-walled compound, my squad waits with rifles pointed west. We've been getting our asses handed to us the entire game. We fall back, form new defensive positions, and eventually get routed to fall back again. We can't get help from the other squads, who are all off in the woods somewhere building tree forts or measuring rifles or whatever it is they do when they're not fighting on the objective.

                Even though we're constantly retreating, I'm playing squad leader to a group full of good players. They're working together and following my directions. The Americans are marching us across the map, but we're making them pay for every inch of ground. A shout goes up. Smoke grenades are popping in the poppy fields to the west. They're coming at us again.
                </p>

                The game refuses to give out extra information, so teammates are the only way to find the enemy and know where to go. When the team is that important, working as a medic to pick a wounded friend off the ground—explosions showering dust, rounds whistling past—makes me feel heroic in a way that other shooters don't.
